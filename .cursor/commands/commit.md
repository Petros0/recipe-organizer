Review the changes that we have done to the codebase and commit with an appropriate message.

Make sure that you also add a relative good description when you are commiting, so that the commit is clear and understood.

Before commiting, also run the tests to see if everything is still working as expected. 

If the commit doesn't have any new changes and just fixes a previous commit, do an amend instead.
